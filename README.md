# Scalable-Library-Management-System
Scalable library management system is designed to provide a flexible and efficient way to manage libraries of any size, from small private collections to large institutions. It is built on a scalable architecture that can handle the needs of libraries of all sizes and can be customized to meet the specific requirements of individual libraries. Using the Scalable Library Management System, librarians can easily manage the library's collection, track circulation activity, and generate reports necessary for analyzing the system's functioning. Additionally, the system provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate and access the required information for tasks such as borrowing and returning library books. 

 

TOOLS USED: 

- Eclipse - Integrated Development Environment for Java Development to build the application. 
- Scene Builder - Layout tool that allows for rapid designing of JavaFX project User Interfaces without coding by drag and Drop control to build the application.
- MySQL Workbench - Used for designing, developing, and managing MySQL databases. Create, modify, and manage tables. Execute SQL queries and generate visual representations of data 
- Git - Version control systems for managing Source Code. 
- Google drive will be used for documentation. 

TECHNOLOGIES USED: 

- Java SE â€“ Used for building standalone applications Java SE provides a standard set of APIs for working with files, networking, concurrency, and other core features, as well as support for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with JavaFX.  <br>
